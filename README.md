### Next Up : I will add a Dictionary API so that user has more words to guess from and will increase the limits accordingly , and also make the hangman Figure a better and a little longer so that the games lasts for more time.

# Python-Hangman-Game
A Python Hangman app is a text-based game that allows users to play the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. In this game, a secret word is chosen, and the player's objective is to guess the letters in the word before making too many incorrect guesses. 


The Game typically includes features such as:

1) Displaying the current state of the word with underscores and correctly guessed letters.
2) Keeping track of incorrect guesses and updating the hangman drawing accordingly.
3) Checking the validity of user input (e.g., ensuring a single letter is entered).
4) Providing feedback to the user on whether their guess was correct or incorrect.
5) Displaying the full word and outcome at the end of the game.


# Note : This code is just an example of hangman game and it still be improved a lot.
